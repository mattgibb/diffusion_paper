    Hearts were isolated from female rats, fixed and embedded in black wax. The wax blocks were then serially sectioned at 10$\mu$m thickness using a microtome. An image of the top surface of the block -- referred to as a `block face image' from here on -- was taken with 25$\mu$m resolution after each slicing. Each slice was relaxed and rehydrated, before histology imaging was performed using a 5x objective with 1.1$\mu$m resolution, the resultant images being referred to as `histology images' from here on. Gibb et al. \cite{Gibb2012} give a detailed account of the experimental methods. Examples of the block face and slice images are displayed in Figure~\ref{fig:raw_images}.

  \subsection{Block Face Registration} % (fold)
  \label{sub:block_face_registration}
    The first stage consists in a slice-by-slice registration between full-resolution histology slices and their corresponding block-face images. All registration software developed for the work presented in this paper is based on ITK \cite{Yoo2002} and is freely available at \cite{github_registration}. We use an TK registration framework, consisting of the two images to be coregistered, and four main components: a transform, an interpolator, a fitness metric and an optimiser.
    
    A histology volume was first formed by aligning histology slices (which have varying sizes depending on the volume of tissue they contain) around their geometric centres. The volume was then manually translated to align approximately with the block-face volume. Subsequently, a multi-step registration process was applied, with transforms gradually increasing in complexity to minimise the influence of local minima in the optimization: 1) centered rigid 2D transform; 2) centered rigid similarity transform; 3) centered rigid affine transform. Each of these steps were tuned using a multi-resolution scheme. 
    
A mean squares difference metric proved most robust over normalised correlation and mutual information. Parameter scalings were chosen heuristically using diagnostic tools that visualise transforms and metric values at each iteration of the registration (specifically developed for this project and available at \cite{github_registration}). A gradient descent algorithm was used for optimisation. A linear interpolator was used to calculate off-grid pixel intensities in all cases. The transforms calculated at the end of this stage are denoted $\mathbf{T}_{i}^{0}$, where the subindex ${i}$ represents the slice number and the superindex ${0}$ the iteration number.

	\subsection{1-Dimensional Brownian Diffusion} % (fold)
	\label{sub:a_1d_random_walk_analogy}
    Due to differences in image resolution apparent in Figure~\ref{fig:raw_images}, registration between high-resolution and block-face images cannot preserve the smoothness of the original sample in the direction normal to the slices. We therefore propose Transformational Diffusion Smoothing (TDS). To illustrate the principle of TDS, we can consider a concentration of particles $f$ over a discrete 1-dimensional grid $x$, where after a small discretised timestep $\Delta t$, a proportion $2\alpha \Delta t$ of the particles take one step, such that half of them have diffused to the left and half to the right:
	  \begin{equation}
      \begin{split}
        f(x_i, t_{n+1}) = & f(x_i, t_n) + \alpha (f(x_{i-1}, t_n) \\
                           & \quad - 2f(x_i, t_n) + f(x_{i+1}, t_n)).
      \end{split}
      \label{eqn:diffusion_1d}
		\end{equation}
	  This diffusion will of course act to smooth and homogenise $f$, since regions of high concentration relative to their neighbours will be reduced, and those of low concentration augmented. The same result could have been obtained by approximating the diffusion equation over a discrete one-dimensional grid. Since the particles move binomially, in accordance with the de Moivre Laplace Theorem it can be shown that multiple application of this smoothing operation approximates a Gaussian diffusion smoothing.

  \subsection{Transformational Diffusion Smoothing} % (fold)
  \label{sub:transformational_diffusion_smoothing}
    \subsubsection{Algorithm Overview} % (fold)
    \label{ssub:algorithm_overview}
    Our goal is to develop an iterative process that `diffuses' each histological slice image toward its neighbours, in order to smooth out high-frequency transformational noise, whilst maintaining the low-frequency underlying geometry of the volume. A transform $\mathbf{T}$ acting on a point $\mathbf{p}$ maps points in the resampling space to points in the original image space:
  		\begin{equation}
  			\mathbf{p'} = \mathbf{Tp}.
  		\end{equation}
    At iteration $n$ of the proposed process, each slice $i$ in a reconstructed histological stack has associated with it an invertible transform $\mathbf{T}_i^n$. We define the `diffusion transform' $\mathbf{\Delta T}_i^{n,n+1}$, which is formulated to move slice $i$ towards slices $i-1$ and $i+1$, based on the results of registrations between adjacent slices. $\mathbf{\Delta T}_i^{n,n+1}$ is pre-applied to a point in the resampling space of $i$ before $\mathbf{T}_i^n$ to give the adjusted transform $\mathbf{T}_i^{n+1}$, such that
    	\begin{equation}
  			\mathbf{T}_i^{n+1} = \mathbf{T}_i^n \mathbf{\Delta T}_i^{n,n+1}. \label{eqn:adjusted_transforms}
  		\end{equation}
	  It remains to formulate $\mathbf{\Delta T}_i^{n,n+1}$, and this is the subject of the following discussion.
    % subsubsection algorithm_overview (end)
    
    \subsubsection{Formulating the Diffusion Transforms} % (fold)
    \label{ssub:formulating_the_diffusion_transforms}
      In the case of 1-dimensional diffusion, we can reformulate the right hand side of (\ref{eqn:diffusion_1d}) into two separate terms:
      \begin{equation}
        \begin{aligned}
          f(x_i, t_{n+1}) = f(x_i, t_n) + \alpha ((f(x_{i+1}, t_n) - f(x_i, t_n)) \\
          - (f(x_{i-1}, t_n) - f(x_i, t_n))) \label{eqn:1d_diffusion_operator}
        \end{aligned}
  	  \end{equation} 
  	  which we can write in simplified notation using:
      \begin{equation}
        \begin{aligned}
          \Delta f_i^{n,n+1} &= \alpha (\Delta f_{i,i+1}^n - \Delta f_{i-1,i}^n) \\
                             &= \alpha \Delta f_{i,i-1}^n + \alpha \Delta f_{i,i+1}^n, \label{eqn:simplified_expressions}
        \end{aligned}
      \end{equation}
      where $\Delta f_i^{m,n}$ is the difference in $f$ at position $i$ between timestep $m$ and timestep $n$, and $\Delta f_{i,j}^m$ is the difference in $f$ between position $i$ and position $j$ at timestep $m$. From (\ref{eqn:1d_diffusion_operator}), we can see that at each timestep, the concentration at each bin moves towards its left and right neighbour by a proportion $\alpha$ of its difference from each, respectively.
		
      Let us propose an analogous formulation for the adjustment transform
      \begin{equation}
        \mathbf{\Delta T}_i^{n,n+1} = \alpha \cdot \mathbf{\Delta T}_{i,i+1}^n \oplus \alpha \cdot \mathbf{\Delta T}_{i,i-1}^n, \label{eqn:transformational_placeholder}
      \end{equation}
      where $\mathbf{\Delta T}_{i,j}^n = (\mathbf{\Delta T}_{j,i}^n)^{-1}$ is defined as the transformation that registers a histological slice $i$ to slice $j$ at iteration $n$, operator $\cdot$ is a placeholder for a binary operator on a scalar and a transform, and operator $\oplus$ is a placeholder for a binary operator on a pair of transforms. We are now equipped to calculate the transforms producing progressively more regularized volumes, by first registering each slice to its neighbour to obtain $\mathbf{\Delta T}_{i,i+1}^n$, then computing the diffusion transforms $\mathbf{\Delta T}_i^{n,n+1}$ through \labelcref{eqn:transformational_placeholder}, and finally applying them to the original transforms through \labelcref{eqn:adjusted_transforms} to obtain $\mathbf{T}_i^{n+1}$. The next Section addresses the question of the definition of the two binary operators $\cdot$ and $\oplus$, starting by outlining their desirable properties, and then proposing suitable implementations.

    \subsubsection{Formulating the Transform Operators} % (fold)
    \label{ssub:formulating_the_transform_operators}
		The operator $\cdot$ takes two operands: a scalar and a transform. We would like $0$ to be the null operand on $\mathbf{T}$, so that when $\alpha = 0$, no diffusion occurs. We would like $1$ to be the identity operand on $\mathbf{T}$, so that when $\alpha = 1$, the transform from each term in (\ref{eqn:transformational_placeholder}) would bring the slice exactly to the position of its equivalent neighbour. Ideally, we would also like addition of the scalar operand to distribute over the serial application of the resultant transforms, so that transforms vary smoothly and naturally with respect to the scalar operand. To summarise in mathematical form, we would like the following to hold:
		\begin{gather}
			0 \cdot \mathbf{T} = \mathbf{I} \label{eqn:null} \\
			1 \cdot \mathbf{T} = \mathbf{T} \label{eqn:identity} \\
			(\alpha \cdot \mathbf{T}) (\beta \cdot \mathbf{T}) = (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \mathbf{T} \label{eqn:distributivity}
		\end{gather}
	  The operator $\oplus$ takes two transform operands. Commutativity must hold if the diffusion is to be symmetric i.e. behave identically if the order of the slices is reversed. If statistics are to be calculated on more than two transformations, it is also necessary for associativity to hold, so that the order of application of operator $\oplus$ is not preferential to any subset of transform operands. That is,
    \begin{gather}
      \forall \mathbf{S}, \mathbf{T} : \mathbf{S} \oplus \mathbf{T} = \mathbf{T} \oplus \mathbf{S} \label{eqn:commutativity} \\
      \forall \mathbf{S}, \mathbf{T} : (\mathbf{S} \oplus \mathbf{T}) \oplus \mathbf{U} = \mathbf{S} \oplus (\mathbf{T} \oplus \mathbf{U}). \label{eqn:associativity}
    \end{gather}
		Unfortunately, commutativity rules out the straightforward serial application of transforms. For example, in the general case of matrix multiplication, $AB \ne BA$. Other simple solutions fail to meet all the conditions above and/or lead to unnatural results, such as the `bulging' effect noted in \cite{Arsigny2005}, and the null matrix in 2D between transforms separated by a rotation of $\pi$.
        
	  In the following we introduce a solution for the class of affine transforms that meets the constraints in  \labelcref{eqn:null,eqn:identity,eqn:distributivity}, together with the commutativity and associativity conditions. An affine transform $\mathbf{T}$ acting on a point $\mathbf{p}$ consists of a matrix transformation $\mathbf{M}$, followed by a translation by an offset vector $\mathbf{o}$:
		\begin{equation}
			\mathbf{p'} = \mathbf{Tp}= \mathbf{Mp} + \mathbf{o}.
		\end{equation}
		We consider first the simplest case of translation transforms, where $\mathbf{M}$ is the identity matrix $\mathbf{I}$ i.e. $\mathbf{Tp} = \mathbf{p} + \mathbf{o}$. The two translation parameters are independent and individually identical to the 1-dimensional diffusion in (\ref{eqn:1d_diffusion_operator}). Operator $\cdot$ is a scalar multiplication of each offset parameter, and operator $\oplus$ is the commutative serial application of the transforms (or equivalently, addition of the respective parameters):
		\begin{align}
			(\alpha \cdot \mathbf{T}) \mathbf{p} &= \mathbf{p} + \alpha\mathbf{o} \label{eqn:translation_cdot}\\
			(\mathbf{S} \oplus \mathbf{T}) \mathbf{p} &= \mathbf{STp} \\
			                                          &= \mathbf{p} + \mathbf{o_S} + \mathbf{o_T} \label{eqn:translation_oplus},
		\end{align}
    where $\mathbf{o_S}$ and $\mathbf{o_T}$ are the translation vectors $\mathbf{o}$ for transforms $\mathbf{S}$ and $\mathbf{P}$, respectively. Clearly, these two operators satisfy \labelcref{eqn:null,eqn:identity,eqn:distributivity,eqn:commutativity,eqn:associativity}. Equation (\ref{eqn:transformational_placeholder}) becomes
		\begin{align}
		 	\mathbf{\Delta T}_i^{n,n+1} \mathbf{p} &= (\alpha \mathbf{\Delta T}_{i,i-1}^n) (\alpha \mathbf{\Delta T}_{i,i+1}^n) \mathbf{p} \\
			\mathbf{p} + \mathbf{o}_i^{n,n+1} &= \mathbf{p} + \alpha \mathbf{o}_{i,i-1}^n + \alpha \mathbf{o}_{i,i+1}^n \\
			\mathbf{o}_i^{n,n+1} &= \alpha (\mathbf{o}_{i,i-1}^n + \mathbf{o}_{i,i+1}^n) 
		\end{align}
		The offsets are therefore trivially analogous to (\ref{eqn:simplified_expressions}).
				
		Considering now the case of affine matrix transformations in the absence of translations, in the general case when $\mathbf{M_S}$ and $\mathbf{M_T}$ no longer commute, serial application of transforms is no longer sufficient. There is also no obvious form of operator $\cdot$ which satisfies \labelcref{eqn:null,eqn:identity,eqn:distributivity}. We must take recourse to a more general formulation of operators $\cdot$ and $\oplus$, for which we borrow the concepts of matrix exponential and Lie algebra \cite{Arsigny2005, Arsigny2005a}

        The matrix exponential is defined as:
        \begin{equation}
          e^{\mathbf{M}} = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{k!}\mathbf{M}^k. \label{eqn:matrix_exponential}
        \end{equation}
        Conversely, a logarithm $\mathbf{L}$ of a matrix $\mathbf{M}$ is another matrix such that $e^\mathbf{L} = \mathbf{M}$. When a matrix $\mathbf{M}$ has a logarithm $\mathbf{L}$, $\mathbf{M}$ is in a Lie group --- a group on a smooth manifold. $\mathbf{L}$ is the corresponding element of the associated Lie algebra. $\mathbf{L}$ is an `infinitessimal generator', and its value determines the tangent space at the identity $\mathbf{I}$. Informally, this means that there exists a matrix $\mathbf{I} + \epsilon \mathbf{L}$ that is extremely close to the identity, such that when applied repeatedly an extremely large number of times i.e. $(\mathbf{I} + \epsilon \mathbf{L})^n$, the result eventually becomes $\mathbf{M}$.
        
        If we define operator $\cdot$ in terms of the exponential and the logarithm of $\mathbf{M}$, \labelcref{eqn:null,eqn:identity,eqn:distributivity} are all satisfied:
        \begin{gather}
          \alpha \cdot \mathbf{M} := e^{\alpha\ln\mathbf{M}} \\
          0 \cdot \mathbf{M} = e^0 = \mathbf{I} \\
          1 \cdot \mathbf{M} = e^{\ln\mathbf{M}} = \mathbf{M} \\
          \begin{split}
            (\alpha \cdot \mathbf{M})(\beta \cdot \mathbf{M}) &= e^{\alpha\ln\mathbf{M}}e^{\beta\ln\mathbf{M}} \\
                                                              &= e^{(\alpha + \beta)\ln\mathbf{M}} \\
                                                              &= (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \mathbf{M}.
          \end{split}
        \end{gather}
        We can define operator $\oplus$ as a simple addition of the matrix logarithms in log-Euclidian space, followed by a mapping back to transform space with the exponential operator:
        \begin{equation}
          \mathbf{M_S} \oplus \mathbf{M_T} := e^{\ln\mathbf{M_S} + \ln\mathbf{M_T}}.
        \end{equation}
        Because all operations are homomorphic with Euclidian vector space, this operator always fulfils the commutativity and associativity criteria
        \begin{gather}
          \mathbf{M_S} \oplus \mathbf{M_T} = e^{\ln\mathbf{M_S} + \ln\mathbf{M_T}} = \mathbf{M_T} \oplus \mathbf{M_S} \\
          \begin{split}
            (\mathbf{M_S}\oplus\mathbf{M_T})\oplus\mathbf{M_U} &= e^{\ln\mathbf{M_S} + \ln\mathbf{M_T} + \ln\mathbf{M_U}} \\
                                                               &= \mathbf{M_S}\oplus(\mathbf{M_T}\oplus\mathbf{M_U}).
          \end{split}
        \end{gather}
        This `log-Euclidian' approach is expounded with great mathematical rigour in \cite{Arsigny2005}. However, being motivated by the interpolation of MRI data, the treatise is limited to tensors; that is, symmetric matrices with no translation.
        
		    So far, the discussion has been limited to cases with zero offset. When offsets are introduced, even when their respective matrices commute, the commutativity of transforms in (\ref{eqn:commutativity}) no longer holds when serial action akin to (\ref{eqn:translation_oplus}) is introduced na\"ively:
        \begin{equation}
          (\mathbf{S} \oplus \mathbf{T})\mathbf{p} = (\mathbf{M_S} \oplus \mathbf{M_T})\mathbf{p} + \mathbf{M_So_T} + \mathbf{o_S} \ne (\mathbf{T} \oplus \mathbf{S})\mathbf{p}.
        \end{equation}
        If commutivity is forced by averaging the offset contributions from both permutations of the operands then associativity breaks down. The same underlying structure precludes a linear interpolation in operator $\cdot$ akin to \labelcref{eqn:translation_cdot} in the presence of a non-identical matrix.

        When $\mathbf{I} - \mathbf{M}$ is invertible, we can express a transform as a matrix transformation about a single invariant centre, with no offset:
        \begin{gather}
          \mathbf{Tp} = \mathbf{Mp} + \mathbf{o} = \mathbf{M}(\mathbf{p}-\mathbf{c}) + \mathbf{c} \\
          \mathbf{o} = (\mathbf{I} - \mathbf{M})\mathbf{c} \\
          \mathbf{c} = (\mathbf{I} - \mathbf{M})^{-1}\mathbf{o}.
        \end{gather}
        We can then reformulate operator $\cdot$ as a log-Euclidian transformation about this invariant centre and satisfy distributivity:
        \begin{gather}
          \alpha \cdot \mathbf{T} = e^{\alpha\ln\mathbf{M}}(p - c) + c \label{eqn:affine_cdot} \\
          \begin{split}
            (\alpha \cdot \mathbf{T})(\beta \cdot \mathbf{T}) &= e^{\alpha\ln\mathbf{M}}((e^{\beta\ln\mathbf{M}}(p - c) + c) - c) + c \\
                                                              &= e^{\alpha\ln\mathbf{M}}(e^{\beta\ln\mathbf{M}}(p - c)) + c \\
                                                              &= e^{(\alpha + \beta)\ln\mathbf{M}}(p - c) + c \\
                                                              &= (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \mathbf{T}.
          \end{split}
        \end{gather}
        With this condition satisfied, $\alpha\cdot\mathbf{T}$ is equivalent to $\mathbf{T}^{\alpha}$.
        
        In order to derive the common centre of the two operands of operator $\oplus$, let us consider the infinitesimal case
        \begin{gather}
          \delta \cdot \mathbf{U} = (\delta \cdot \mathbf{S}) \oplus (\delta \cdot \mathbf{T}) \approx (\delta \cdot \mathbf{S}) (\delta \cdot \mathbf{T}) \\
          \begin{aligned}
            &e^{\delta(\ln \mathbf{M_S} + \ln \mathbf{M_T})}\mathbf{p} \\
            &+ (\mathbf{I} - e^{\delta(\ln \mathbf{M_S} + \ln \mathbf{M_T})})\mathbf{c_U}
          \end{aligned} = \begin{aligned}
              &e^{\delta \ln \mathbf{M_S}}e^{\delta \ln \mathbf{M_T}}\mathbf{p} \\
              &+ e^{\delta \ln \mathbf{M_S}}(\mathbf{I} - e^{\delta \ln \mathbf{T}})\mathbf{c_T} \\
              &+ (\mathbf{I} - e^{\delta \ln \mathbf{M_S}})\mathbf{c_S}, \label{eqn:infinitesimal_oplus}
          \end{aligned}
        \end{gather}
        where $\mathbf{c_T}$ and $\mathbf{c_S}$ are the respective centres of the transforms $\mathbf{T}$ and $\mathbf{S}$.
        We can see from the series in (\ref{eqn:matrix_exponential}) that
        \begin{equation}
          e^{\delta \ln \mathbf{M}} = \mathbf{I} + \delta \ln \mathbf{M} + \mathcal{O}((\delta \ln \mathbf{M})^2).
        \end{equation}
        Applying this to (\ref{eqn:infinitesimal_oplus}), we obtain
        \begin{equation}
          (\ln\mathbf{M_S} + \ln\mathbf{M_T})\mathbf{c_U} = (\ln\mathbf{M_S})\mathbf{c_S} + (\ln\mathbf{M_T})\mathbf{c_T}.
        \end{equation}
        The general form of operator $\oplus$ is then finally
        \begin{gather}
          \mathbf{S} \oplus \mathbf{T} = e^{\ln\mathbf{M_S} + \ln\mathbf{M_T}}(\mathbf{p} - \mathbf{c}) + \mathbf{c}, \nonumber \\
          \mathbf{c} = (\ln\mathbf{M_S} + \ln\mathbf{M_T})^{-1}((\ln\mathbf{M_S})\mathbf{c_S} + (\ln\mathbf{M_T})\mathbf{c_T}). \label{eqn:affine_oplus}
        \end{gather}
        Commutativity is evident by inspection, and associativity is simply demonstrated:
        \begin{gather}
          \begin{split}
            (\mathbf{S} \oplus \mathbf{T}) \oplus \mathbf{U} &= \exp(\ln(e^{\ln\mathbf{M_S} + \ln\mathbf{M_T}}) + \ln\mathbf{M_U})(\mathbf{p} - \mathbf{c}) \\
                                                             &\quad + \mathbf{c} \\
                                                             &= e^{\ln\mathbf{M_S} + \ln\mathbf{M_T} + \ln\mathbf{M_U}}(\mathbf{p} - \mathbf{c}) + \mathbf{c},
          \end{split} \\
          \begin{split}
            \mathbf{c} =& (\ln\mathbf{M_{S \oplus T}} + \ln\mathbf{M_U})^{-1} \\
                       &\quad ((\ln\mathbf{M_{S \oplus T}})\mathbf{c_{S \oplus T}} + (\ln\mathbf{M_U})\mathbf{c_U}) \\
                       =& (\ln\mathbf{M_S} + \ln\mathbf{M_T} + \ln\mathbf{M_U})^{-1} \\
                       &\quad ((\ln\mathbf{M_S})\mathbf{c_S} + (\ln\mathbf{M_T})\mathbf{c_T} + (\ln\mathbf{M_U})\mathbf{c_U}).
          \end{split}
        \end{gather}
        Finally, it can be shown from \labelcref{eqn:affine_cdot,eqn:affine_oplus} that the operation of $\cdot$ by a scalar distributes over the operation of $\oplus$ on two affine transformations. In particular,
        \begin{equation}
          (\alpha \cdot \mathbf{S}) \oplus (\alpha \cdot \mathbf{T}) = \alpha \cdot (\mathbf{S} \oplus \mathbf{T}).
        \end{equation}
        In the case where $\mathbf{M} - \mathbf{I}$ is singular and there is no central invariate coordinate along the singular dimensions, it is of course natural that operator $\cdot$ interpolates the translation coordinates linearly along those dimensions as in (\ref{eqn:translation_cdot}), and that operator $\oplus$ sums translations arithmetically as in (\ref{eqn:translation_oplus}).
        
        A similar Lie theoretical approach must be taken when implementing operators $\cdot$ and $\oplus$ for more general non-rigid transforms, such as displacement field transforms. However, any differentiable transform will approximate an affine transformation at scales smaller than its curvature, and the implementations expounded here can be used in a locally affine framework to produce deformable transforms.

  \subsection{TDS on Synthetic Geometries} % (fold)
    \label{sub:tds_on_synthetic_geometries}
    In order to test the efficacy of the algorithm in a quantitative way, and in the absence of ground truth for our histological datasets, we built several test geometries, mimicking the results of initial block-face registration as introduced in Section \ref{sub:block_face_registration}. A synthetic histological volume was produced by first stacking 200 copies of a single histology slice. Affine transformations were then applied to each of the slices, with the transformations defined by the composition of two components. The first component aims at simulating the natural 3D sample, and is defined by a sinusoidal function: a translational signal of amplitude approximately half the dimension of the heart section, and a rotational signal spanning 90$^{\circ}$, out of phase with the translational signal by 90$^{\circ}$. The second component aims at simulating inter-slice registration errors appearing in the initial alignment. The transform parameters of each slice are perturbed by random Gaussian noise, with translational standard deviation equal to half the amplitude of the translational signal, and the standard deviation of the affine matrix elements equal to 0.1. In order to illustrate the banana effect, we also performed serial slice-to-slice registrations: the bottom slice is kept at its original location and the rest are registered sequentially to the slice immediately below.
  
  \subsection{TDS on Block Face-Registered Histology} % (fold)
    \label{sub:diffusion_on_block_face_registered_histology}
    The TDS method was tested on an entire rat heart, and subsequently on a smaller region around a sub-epicardial vessel, in order to demonstrate the effects of a locally applied affine transformation. 20 iterations were applied in both cases, with the value of $\alpha$ set to $0.4$. Serial slice-to-slice registrations were also performed for illustration.
